## 🚀 Featured Projects

## Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones (https://github.com/hariharanselvam2001/Human-Activity-Recognition-using-Smartphones)
> ✅ Achieved 94.41% test accuracy using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with PCA-based dimensionality reduction on sensor time-series data from smartphones, effectively classifying six human activities (e.g., walking, sitting, laying).

> 🧠 Engineered high-impact features (e.g., motion energy, jerk magnitude, gyro ratios) from 561 raw sensor channels, then applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain 95% variance using only 179 components — enabling efficient and robust classification.

> 📊 Performed advanced preprocessing and EDA, including outlier detection, skewness/kurtosis analysis, and correlation heatmaps to uncover feature redundancy and prepare the data for classification models like Logistic Regression and SVM.

### 🌾 [U.S. Agricultural Export Forecasting (1975–2024)](https://github.com/hariharanselvam2001/Time-Series-Forecast-of-US-Agricultural-Exports)
> Time series forecasting using SARIMA and SARIMA-EXO models  
> ✅ Improved export prediction by incorporating imports as exogenous variables  
> ✅ Achieved a MAPE of 2.34%  

---

### 🛍️ [Online Shoppers’ Purchase Intentions](https://github.com/hariharanselvam2001/Online-Shoppers-Purchasing-Intention)
> 🧠 Built classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM) to analyze e-commerce data  
> ✅ Identified usability factors that increased customer count by 15%  
> ✅ Achieved 85% precision and 82% recall
